    <h1>About this Page</h1>
    <p>This is a collection of thoughts and observations, written thanks to the generosity of github.com. It is also an experiment in using only the most basic of HTML elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>h1-6</li>
      <li>p</li>
      <li>blockquote</li>
      <li>ol</li>
      <li>ul</li>
      <li>i</li>
      <li>b</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I wonder how well such code holds up when viewed on different devices.</p>
    <p>For the rest, I intend it to be a sort of a blog, since I will add to it, from time to time, always at the top, so that the ‘posts’ appear in reverse chronological order. I am also thinking of adding tags in a twitter-like fashion.</p>
    <h1>About N. R. Swalepoole, that is, me</h1>
    <p>‘Swalepoole’ is of course a <i>nom de blog</i>. I choose to remain somewhat anonymous in order that my reflections should be as uncensored as I can make them.</p>

<h3>Agriculture and Soil 2015-01-01</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>here is a simple rule for keeping the soil there in the field where you plant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What comes out of the soil, goes back into the soil. The <i>same</i> soil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plants take nutrients (minerals, water, carbon, hydrogen, other elements) out of the soil. These then go into the air (oxygen), into the plant material, and into other creatures (including bacteria that feed of the plant&#8217;s roots, and animals like us who eat parts of the plant). We creatures then process these elemental nutrients and take some of them into our own material, and others we egest after processing.</p>

<p>So if these plant materials upon processing are not returned to the soil, the soil has lost the elements that went into the creation of these materials. Some of these elements are returned from outside the soil: rain brings hydrogen and oxygen back into the soil, and plants pull carbon and oxygen out of the air. The rest of the elements are gone &#8211; unless they are put back.</p>

<p>Biologically and ecologically, there is no such thing as &#8216;agricultural waste.&#8217; This is instead an economics concept meaning &#8216;whatever the farmer cannot sell.&#8217; Economics does not recognize the other sciences, it exists in its own realm of pure mathematics and hooey.</p>

<p>The cycle of agriculture must then be designed so that &#8220;what comes out of the soil, goes back into the soil. The same soil.&#8221; This means that the piss and shit of animals that feed of the plants, along with their carcases, must be returned to that soil.</p>

<p>Or else the soil grows poorer.</p>


<h3>Saving Energy in Web Design – 2015-06-01</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><i>(Tags: #EnerGy #WebDesign)</i></p>

<p>Looking over this site on various devices strikes me how blank it is. How <em>white</em> it is. How <em>bright</em> it is.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a campaign from the early 2000s urging web designers to write web pages in predominantly dark colors. Doing so, it was urged, would save enormous kiloWatts of electricity.</p>

<p>But this only is true of cathode ray tube monitors. LCD displays use more energy displaying dark colors than they do white. And since LCD displays are the dominant form of displays now, bright and white web pages use less energy when they are viewed.</p>

<p>OLED screens, though, are like CRT screens: OLED uses next to no energy to display black, and the most energy to display white.</p>

<p>So we have gone from one philosophy to its opposite and, if the manufacture and permanence of OLED screen technology can be perfected, we will go back to the original.</p>
