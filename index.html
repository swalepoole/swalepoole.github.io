    <h1>About this Page</h1>
    <p>This is a collection of thoughts and observations, written thanks to the generosity of github.com. It is also an experiment in using only the most basic of HTML elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>h1-6</li>
      <li>p</li>
      <li>blockquote</li>
      <li>ol</li>
      <li>ul</li>
      <li>i</li>
      <li>b</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I wonder how well such code holds up when viewed on different devices.</p>
    <p>For the rest, I intend it to be a sort of a blog, since I will add to it, from time to time, always at the top, so that the ‘posts’ appear in reverse chronological order. I am also thinking of adding tags in a twitter-like fashion.</p>
    <h1>About N. R. Swalepoole, that is, me</h1>
    <p>‘Swalepoole’ is of course a <i>nom de blog</i>. I choose to remain somewhat anonymous in order that my reflections should be as uncensored as I can make them.</p>
